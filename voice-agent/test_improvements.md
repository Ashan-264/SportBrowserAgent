# Testing Improvements for Answer Extraction

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Text Extraction (`/api/execute`)

- Now tries multiple selectors from comma-separated list
- Extracts text from all matching elements, not just first one
- Added fallback selectors for common search result patterns
- Better handling of meaningful content (filters short text)

### 2. Enhanced Firecrawl Targeting (`/api/firecrawl`)

- Smart URL selection based on query type
- For "richest person" queries â†’ directly target Forbes billionaires list
- Default to DuckDuckGo instead of Google to avoid CAPTCHA
- Better content extraction settings

### 3. Updated Automation Steps (`/api/refine`)

- Focus on extracting answer snippets, not just result containers
- Better selectors for answer boxes and content snippets
- Extract content before taking screenshots for better context

## Expected Improvements

For the question "who is the richest man in the world":

**Before:**

- Text extraction: "forbes.comOnly include results for this siteRedo search..."
- Answer: Generic "I found information" message

**After:**

- Text extraction: Should get actual snippets with billionaire names and net worth
- Answer: Should provide specific names and wealth information

## Test Results

To test, ask the same question: "who is the richest man in the world"

Expected flow:

1. Firecrawl scrapes Forbes billionaires page directly
2. Browser automation extracts meaningful content snippets
3. Answer generation creates natural language response with actual names/data
